Welcome to BettrMe!

BettrMe is a single-page application that is designed to help you set goals for yourself and track the completion of those goals.

The main idea behind the app is to assist in creating new healthy habits, and holding yourself accountable for maintaining those habits.

The application is in an early stage of development, and there are many features that I am planning to add to help the user feel more motivated to achieve their goals!
